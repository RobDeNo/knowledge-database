Situation: Other teams have identified a networked binary from a Donovian development network, a copy is located with the /longTermStorage on the Donovian Webserver. It is common software for the region and is believed to be running in both the Donovian and Gorgan internal networks. Discover vulnerabilities and create a reliable exploit to gain remote access. This will enable remote exploitation against Donovian targets and provide the basis for developing mitigations on friendly Gorgan networks.

Provided:
Executable Package: SecureServerind.exe & essfunc.dll
Task: Perform a remote buffer overflow on the vulnerable Windows executable from your Linux_analyst box. Gain a shell using exploit code Method: Utilize RE toolset and python to launch and develop exploit.

Launch your remote exploit at the Donovian Windows target on 192.168.150.245 to gain initial access. Your flag is within the public documents .
