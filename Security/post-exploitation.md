# Using Stolen SSH Keys
- Bring private key to your own box
- on your box
```shell

- go into ssh directory 
cd /home/usr/.ssh
cat id_rsa
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

.........dsfafewfwrfwr3ffrfwfrw4fwgwrgw
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
# copy and paste the private key back to your local machine, place into a folder
chmod 600 /home/student/stolenkey
# Call upon key when doing ssh with
ssh -i /home/student/stolenkey jane@1.2.3.4
```
# Control Sockets 
## Command Line Method
```shell
ssh -M -S /tmp/s root@<IP ADDRESS> <TUNNEL COMMANDS -R or -L>
# -M is Master Sockets
# -S specifies specifies control path for connection
ssh -o 'Control
ssh -S /tmp/socket student@1.2.3.4
scp -o 'ControlPath=/tmp/s' x@x:<Path>
```
## Configuration File Method (~/.ssh/ssh_config)
```shell
HostName *
ControlPath ~/.ssh/controlmasters/%r@%h:%p
ControlMaster auto
ControlPersist 10m
ssh -M -S /tmp/socket student@10.50.24.40

# What are we trying to accomplish doing host enumeration? Gathering information about the environment in order  to escalate privileges, gather more information about the network, learn the habits of an admin is he a baddie.. There was times during ops you had to actually fix their own network for them in order to complete a task
# When checking directories remember to always use ls -la. You never know what can be hiding.


#Linux Commands
date & time	        #knowing date and time can help correlate logs and identify target's time zone 
whoami	            #who we are logged in as
id		            #permissions group ( do we have root permissions)
groups 	            #see what groups we are in (are we in the sudoers)
sudo -l             #do we have any binaries that execute with higher privs  
cat /etc/passwd	    #user information
cat /etc/shadow     #user information (need privileged access)
w                   #who is logged in, terminal and what they are doing (tty are direct connections to the pc.. So pts are ssh or telnet connections)
last                #information about users that logged in (user habits, might need to avoid times)
uptime              #how long has the machine been up (would this make for a good pivot)

#Logging
cat /etc/rsyslog.conf   #default rsyslog config file, check rules and for remote logging 
/etc/rsyslog.d 		    #directory where config files are kept we want to check those also.
/var/log		        #default location for linux system logs
#Crontabs
#Why might we want to check Crontabs? What could we take advantage of? Crontabs are owned by respective users so you will not be able to see other users crontabs. Multiple ways and places to look for cron jobs/scripts.
/var/spool/cron/crontabs
/etc/cron.d
ls -la /etc/cron*
cat /etc/cron*  crontab
sudo crontab -u student -l

#Finding files and locations to check
find usaga examples:
find / -name password* 2>/dev/null      #find any file starting with the word password 
find / -iname *test* 2>/dev/null        #find any file with "test" somewhere in its name, ignoring capitalization
find / -type f -name *.txt              #find all .txt files        
find / -type f -name ".*"               #find all hidden files
find / -type d -name ".*"               #find all hidden directories

/tmp		#check tmp folders (world writable)
/home	 	#check home folders for users
/etc        #default location for config files
