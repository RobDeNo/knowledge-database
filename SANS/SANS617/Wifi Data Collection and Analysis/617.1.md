**Lab 1.1 802.11 Packet Analysis**
**Beacon Frames**
1. Frame Control Field 0x8000 / [80 00] 
   1. [80] first two bits are the type
   2. [00] second two bits are the subtype
2. Frame Types
   1. Management Frames (Type 0) - These are frames that manage a BSS  
      1. Beacon Frames
      2. Prob frames
      3. Deauth Frames
   2. Control Frames ( Type 1)
   3. Data type (type 2)
      1. can also view if data is encypted via "tkip" perametrs
3. **Flags** - These define charatcerisitcs of the frame or the wirless network
   1. **To DS / From DS** - direction of the frame
      1. CLIENT to ACCESSPOINT [ to DS ]
      2. ACCESSPOINT to CLIENT [ From DS ]
      3. NIETHER SET = AD-HOC network
      4. BOTH SET = Wireless Distribution Network [Mesh]
         1. Asses to ds and from ds = 0 ~ management frames not using (QoS)
         2. assess to ds=1 and from ds=0 means management frmes using QoS
   2. **Power Management** - should station remain in active or power saving mode
   3. **More Data** - client should not go into power save mode
   4. **Protected** encyption being used, but won't say which
   5. **Order** - quality of service messed this flag up 
   6. **WIRESHARK Filter**
      1. Management Only ```wlan.fc.type == 0``` 
      2. Control ```wlan.fc.type == 1```
      3. Data  ```wlan.fc.type == 2```

**Wireless Management**
- within here we can see what the sender is probing for
1. **Wireshark**
   1. Prob request ```wlan.fc.subtype == 4```
   2. Prob response ```wlan.fc.subtype == 5```
2. **Tagged Parameters (77 Bytes)**
   1. Encryptions Type ~ WPA / -> Version
      1. Encyprtion Protocol - TKIP
      2. Authentciation types ~ TKIP 802.1X Enterprise mode

**Lab 1.2 Monistor Mode and Kismet**
```ifconfig -a```  ifconfig - configure a network interface
   ```-a``` - play all interfaces which are currently available, even if down
   ```-s``` - play a short list (like netstat -i)
   ```-v``` - more verbose for some error conditions
```iw dev``` iw - show / manipulate wireless devices and their configuration
